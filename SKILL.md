# Better Angels Appeal

## The Philosophy of Better Angels

### Lincoln's Approach

In his First Inaugural Address, with war imminent and passions inflamed, Lincoln closed not with threats but with an appeal to what was highest in his audience:

> "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."

### Why Better Angels Appeals Work

**Dignity creates motivation:** People who feel trusted to rise will often rise. People who feel assumed to be base will often sink.

**Self-image is powerful:** We act consistently with who we believe ourselves to be. Appealing to someone's best self invokes that identity.

**Fear fades, purpose endures:** Fear motivates briefly but breeds resentment. Purpose motivates sustainably.

**Contrast with manipulation:** Audiences increasingly recognize and reject manipulative appeals. Sincere better angels appeals stand out.

## Contrast: Fear/Self-Interest vs. Better Angels

### Fear/Self-Interest Appeals (Avoid)
- "If you don't act, terrible things will happen to you"
- "Your competitors are getting ahead while you fall behind"
- "Don't you want to prove them wrong?"
- "Imagine how you'll feel when you miss this opportunity"

### Better Angels Appeals (Embrace)
- "This is an opportunity to be who you aspire to be"
- "What we do now will be remembered. Let it be worthy of memory"
- "You have demonstrated this capacity before. You will demonstrate it again"
- "Together, we can build something better than any of us alone"

## The Structure of a Better Angels Appeal

### 1. Establish Shared Identity
Connect the audience to their best self-conception. Who do they aspire to be? What values do they hold?

**Pattern:** "You are people who [positive identity/value]. This has always been true of you."

### 2. Name the Challenge Honestly
Do not minimize the difficulty. Better angels appeals are not naive—they acknowledge the hard path.

**Pattern:** "What lies before us is difficult. It will require [honest statement of cost]."

### 3. Connect Challenge to Identity
Show how meeting this challenge is an expression of who they already are, not a demand that they become something foreign.

**Pattern:** "This is precisely the moment for which [their values/identity] prepared you."

### 4. Paint the Worthy Outcome
Describe what success looks like in terms of meaning, not just results. What will they have built? What will they be able to say?

**Pattern:** "When this is done, you will have [meaningful achievement]. That cannot be taken from you."

### 5. Express Genuine Confidence
This must be sincere. False confidence is instantly detectable. If you don't believe in them, the appeal will fail.

**Pattern:** "I trust you to rise to this. I have seen you do so before."

### 6. Call to Action
Be specific about what you're asking. Better angels appeals end in action, not sentiment.

**Pattern:** "Here is what I ask: [specific action]. Will you?"

## Constraints

- Must be sincere—audiences detect false better angels appeals instantly
- Does not work if you secretly hold the audience in contempt
- Not a substitute for addressing legitimate grievances—better angels appeals fail when people feel unheard
- Does not mean avoiding hard truths; it means framing them in terms of what's possible
- Requires genuine belief that the audience can rise; if you don't believe it, don't attempt it

## Example

**Input:** "I need to rally my startup team after we failed to hit our Q3 targets. Morale is low. Some people are wondering if we'll make it. I want to inspire them for Q4 without being fake or ignoring reality."

**Output:**

## Better Angels Appeal: The Quarter That Defines Us

### Audience
Startup team demoralized by missed Q3 targets. Their best self-conception: builders who take on hard challenges, people who joined a startup because they wanted to matter.

### The Appeal

Team,

I'm not going to pretend Q3 went well. It didn't. We set targets and we missed them. That is a fact, and we've spent the last two weeks understanding why.

But I want to say something that I believe is more important than the numbers on a spreadsheet.

You didn't join this company for a predictable path. None of us did. We are here because we wanted to build something that matters—and because we believed we were the people who could do it.

That belief was not wrong.

Look around this room. I see people who left comfortable jobs because they wanted to be challenged. I see people who work on problems at midnight not because anyone asked them to, but because they care about getting it right. I see people who have already overcome obstacles that would have stopped a lesser team.

Q4 will be harder than Q3. I won't pretend otherwise. The targets we need to hit are ambitious. The timeline is tight. Some days will be discouraging.

But here is what I know: the teams that define themselves in difficult moments are not the ones who avoid failure. They are the ones who respond to it. They are the ones who look at a setback and ask not "Why did this happen to us?" but "What will we do now?"

That is who you are. I have seen it. I saw it when we shipped the V2 release with two days' warning. I saw it when we landed our first enterprise customer against five established competitors. I saw it in the way you've shown up these last two difficult weeks—not with excuses, but with ideas.

A year from now, we will look back at this quarter. We will either remember it as the moment we stumbled and never recovered—or as the moment we discovered what we were made of.

I trust you to make it the second story.

Here is what I am asking: Give Q4 everything you have. Not for the metrics, not for the board, not for me—but for the thing we are building and for the people in this room building it alongside you.

I believe we will look back on this quarter with pride. I believe that because I believe in you.

Let's get to work.

### Elements Analysis
- **Shared Identity:** Builders who joined to take on hard challenges and matter
- **Challenge Named:** Q3 was a miss; Q4 will be harder; timeline is tight
- **Connection Made:** Defining teams are those who respond to failure, not those who avoid it
- **Worthy Outcome:** Looking back with pride; being the team that discovered what they were made of
- **Confidence Expressed:** "I trust you" / "I believe in you" based on specific past examples
- **Call to Action:** Give Q4 everything—not for external validation but for the mission and each other

### Delivery Notes
- **Tone:** Honest about the difficulty, genuinely warm about the team, resolute about the future
- **Timing:** Deliver early in Q4, ideally at the kickoff; not immediately after the miss when emotions are raw
- **Risks:** If leadership doesn't model the commitment being asked for, the appeal will feel hollow. Follow with visible leadership effort.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Abraham Lincoln** expert persona. Use it when you need to inspire action without resorting to fear, manipulation, or empty positivity. Lincoln understood that people will often rise to meet noble expectations—if those expectations are offered with sincerity and respect for their dignity.
